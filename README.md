  ## Usage
  To use the Note Taker, the user can click the "Get Started" button.  This takes the user to the notes page.  Click on "Text Title" to add a title.  Click in the notes area to add a note.  Once the note has a title and text, a disc button appears in the top right.  Click the disc to save.  The note will now appear in the list on the left side of the page.  To look at a note in the list, click on the title of that note.  When a note is selected, click the pencil in the top right of the page to clear the note to write a new one.
